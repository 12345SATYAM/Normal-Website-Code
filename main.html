    			<h3>html 5</h3>
    			<p>Beautiful HTML is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about CSS, I always begin by telling them that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of clean, semantic HTML are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.

    			<h3>css3 styling</h3>
    			<p>What is the most annoying thing in styling websites? Well, I guess many would agree that writing code can sometimes be really irritating and confusing. Quite often, developers experience much troubles with writing CSS as it takes much time to type in all the rules and commands. You may be happy to know that there is a way to save yourself some time. A proper CSS generator is exactly what you need for creating a minified and clean code quick and easy.</p>
